# ICPR LEAF INSPECT CHALLENGE
## Goal: Leaf instance segmentation
**ML framework used: Pytorch**

**Ml model used: Mask2former by facebook**

**Note:** Recommended to use GPU for training and testing. Code written in google colab environment

This repository contains 2 notebooks
>1. Train_model.ipynb This notebook is used to train the model. You can change the source directories for the dataset at the beginning of the notebook.

>2. Test_model.ipynb This notebook is used to test the model. You can change the source directories for the dataset and model used at the beginning of the notebook.

The dataset provided has been preprocesssed to match the format expecterd by mask2former for instance segmentation tasks. More details are available in the notebook.
